## Description

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe recreated for the browser in JavaScript. This game is meant to be played by two people simultaneously in order for them to compete against one other in trying to place three signs next to each other in any direction in a grid.

Good luck and have fun!


## How To Start The Game

To start playing Tic Tac Toe, all you have to do is to click on this link: <https://peterroman.codes/tic-tac-toe>.

In the main menu, each player can choose a name which is referenced throughout the game to see whose turn it is, and a sign, which can be placed in the grid. Click the "Start Game" button once the information is filled.

When you're in the game, you can see a message on top indicating whose turn it is, and a grid in the center. The player whose turn it is can click on any empty square in the grid to place the sign. The player who manages to place three signs next to each other in any direction first wins and gets 1 extra point.

When the game is over, there is a possiblity to play again, reset the score for both players, or to go back to the main menu.
